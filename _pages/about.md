This blog is to help document things I have been exploring and playing with. 

Hopefully it will help you in a way, as it is a way for me to document things for my 'future' self as my 'current' self will tend to forget things. :-)

### Current things
- Use Python to Automate DNAC via API
- Python automation with API, have also been teaching Python DNAC API internally in the company.
- Webhooks with Python 

### Upcoming things
- All things Docker
- Thousand Eyes

Many more things but with a limited lifespan need to optimise the effort. 
But the important thing is to have fun learning/exploring and to share the lessons learnt.
