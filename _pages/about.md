This blog is to help document things I have been exploring and playing with. 

Hopefully it will help you in a way, as it is a way for me to document things for my 'future' self as my 'current' self will tend to forget things. :-)

Message me (LinkedIn/signal/whatsapp...morse code..smoke signal) and let me know if you are exploring something interesting that I should look into as well.

Below is a dynamic list I am exploring:
### Current things
- Webhooks with Python 
- Terraform
- Use Python to Automate DNAC via API
- Python automation with API, have also been teaching Python DNAC API internally in the company.

### Upcoming things
- All things Docker
- Thousand Eyes

Many more things but with a limited lifespan need to optimise the effort. 
But the important thing is to have fun learning/exploring and to share the lessons learnt.
